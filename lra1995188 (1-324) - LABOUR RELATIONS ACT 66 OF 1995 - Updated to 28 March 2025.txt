(1) Where an employ carries on or conducts two or more operations that are independent of each other by reason of their size, function or organisation, the constitution may provide for the establishment of a co-ordinating workplace forum with jurisdiction over those matters mentioned in sections 84 and 86 that affect the employees generally and for the establishment of a subsidiary workplace forum in each of the workplaces with jurisdiction over those matters that affect only the employees in that workplace.

(2) Where the employer has a workplace that is geographically dispersed and there are matters that are of local interest rather than general interest, the constitution may establish a co-ordinating workplace forum with general jurisdiction and subsidiary workplace forums with local interest jurisdiction.

Example-

A bank with a head office may have many branches dispersed around the country. If the branches are not regarded as separate workplaces, the bank may have one workplace forum for all its employees or the constitution may allow for the establishment of a co-ordinating workplace forum at head office level and in certain or all of the branches allow the establishment of subsidiary workplace forums that will deal with matters that affect only the employees in those branches.

PART F - PENSION MATTERS

23. Continuation of existing pension rights of staff members of Commission upon assuming employment

(1) Any staff member of the Commission who, immediately before assuming employment with the Commission, is a member of the Government Service Pension Fund, the Temporary Employees Pension Fund or any other pension fund or scheme administered by the Department of Finance (hereinafter referred to as an officer or employee), may upon assuming that employment-

(a) choose to remain a member of that pension fund, and from the date of exercising the choice, the officer or employee, despite the provisions of any other law, will be deemed to be a dormant member of the relevant pension fund within the contemplation of section 15(1)(a) of the General Pensions Act, 1979 (Act 29 of 1979);

(a) the pension fund of which the officer or employee was a member ("the former fund") must transfer to the pension fund of which the officer or employee becomes a member of ("the new fund") an amount equal to the funding level of the former fund multiplied by its actuarial liability in respect of that officer or employee at the date the officer or employee assumes


Page 287:

office with the Commission, increased by the amount of interest calculated on that amount at the prime rate of interest from the date when employment with the Commission commenced up to the date of transfer of the amount;

(b) membership of the officer or employee of the former fund will lapse from the date when employment with the Commission commenced, and from that date the officer or employee will cease to have any further claim against the former fund except as provided in paragraph (a); and

(c) the former fund must transfer any claim it may have against the officer or employee, to the new fund.

(3) In the case where an officer or employee becomes a member of a new fund after a request in terms of subitem (1)(c) the State must pay the new fund an amount equal to the difference between the actuarial liability of the former fund in respect of the officer or employee as on the date of the commencement of employment with the Commission, and the amount transferred in terms of subitem (2)(c) to the new fund, increased by the amount of interest thereon calculated at the prime rate from the date of commencement of employment up to the date of the transfer of the amount.

(4) Subitems (2) and (3) will apply, read with the changes required by the context, in respect of any officer or employee who, by reason of having made a choice in terms of subitem (1)(a), has become a dormant member and thereafter requests that the pension benefits that had accrued, be transferred in terms of section 15A(1) of the General Pensions Act, 1979, to another pension fund referred to in that Act or a pension fund registered in terms of the Pension Funds Act, 1956.

(5) If, after an officer or employee has become a member of any other pension fund, by reason of having made a choice in terms of subitem (1)(c), a lump sum benefit has become payable by that pension fund by reason of the death, or the withdrawal or resignation from the pension fund, or retirement, of the officer or employee, or the winding-up of the pension fund, then, for the purposes of paragraph (e) of the definition of "gross income" in section 1 of the Income Tax Act, 1962 (Act 58 of 1962), the pension fund will be deemed, in relation to such officer or employee, to be a fund referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of "pension fund" in section 1 of that Act.

(6) For the purposes of this item-

"actuarial liability" of a pension fund in respect of a particular member or a group of members of the fund, means the actuarial liability that is determined by an actuary who the Minister has nominated for that purpose;


Page 288:
===

"funding level", in relation to a pension fund, means the market value of the assets of the fund stated as a percentage of the total actuarial liability of the fund, after those assets and liabilities have been reduced by the amount of the liabilities of the fund in respect of all its pensioners, as determined at the time of the most recent actuarial valuation of the fund or any review thereof carried out under direction of the responsible Minister; and

"prime rate of interest" means the average prime rate of interest of the three largest banks in the Republic.

(i) the applicant has given written notice to the respondent of the applicant's intention to apply for the granting of an order;

(ii) the respondent has been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard before a decision concerning that application is taken; and

(iii) the applicant has shown good cause why a period shorter than four days should be permitted;

(b) an application made in terms of section 189A(13) must be enrolled by the Labour Court on an expedited basis.

Schedule 8 CODE OF GOOD PRACTICE: DISMISSAL

1. Introduction

(1) This code of good practice deals with some of the key aspects of dismissals for reasons related to conduct sand capacity. It is intentionally general. Each case if unique, and departures from the norms established by this Code may be justified in proper circumstances. For example, the number of employees employed in an establishment may warrant a different approach.

(2) This Act emphasises the primacy of collective agreements. This Code is not intended as a substitute for disciplinary codes and procedures where these are the subject of collective agreements, or the outcome of joint decision-making by an employer and a workplace forum.


Page 293:
===

(3) The key principle in this Code is that employers and employees should treat one another with mutual respect. A premium is placed on both employment justice and the efficient operation of business. While employees should be protected from arbitrary action, employers are entitled to satisfactory conduct and work performance from their employees.

2. Fair reasons for dismissal

(1) A dismissal is unfair if it is not affected for a fair reason and in accordance with a fair procedure, even if it complies with any notice period in a contract of employment or in legislation governing employment. Whether or not a dismissal is for a fair reason is determined by the facts of the case, and the appropriateness of dismissal as a penalty. Whether or not the procedure is fair is determined by referring to the guidelines set out below.

(2) This Act recognises three grounds on which a termination of employment might be legitimate. These are: the conduct of the employee, the capacity of the employee, and the operational requirements of the employer's business.

(3) This Act provides that a dismissal is automatically unfair if the reason for the dismissal is one that amounts to an infringement of the fundamental rights of employees and trade unions, or if the reason is one of those listed in section 187. The reasons include participation in a lawful strike, intended or actual pregnancy and acts of discrimination.

(4) In cases where the dismissal is not automatically unfair, the employer must show that the reason for dismissal is a reason related to the employee's conduct or capacity, or is based on the operational requirements of the business. If the employer fails to do that, or fails to prove that the dismissal was effected in accordance with a fair procedure, the dismissal is unfair.

3. Disciplinary measures short of dismissal

[Schedule 8 item 3 heading substituted by s 57 of Act 42 of 1996.]

Disciplinary procedures prior to dismissal

(1) All employers should adopt disciplinary rules that establish the standard of conduct required of their employees. The form and content of disciplinary rules will obviously vary according to the size and nature of the employer's business. In general, a larger business will require a more formal approach to discipline. An employer's rules must create certainty and consistency in the application of discipline. This requires that the standards of conduct are clear and made available to employees in a manner that is easily understood. Some rules of standards may be so well established and known that it is not necessary to communicate them.


Page 294:
===

(2) The courts have endorsed the concept of corrective or progressive discipline. This approach regards the purpose of discipline as a means for employees to know and understand what standards are required of them. Efforts should be made to correct employees' behaviour through a system of graduated disciplinary measures such as counselling and warnings.

(3) Formal procedures do not have to be invoked every time a rule is broken or a standard is not met. Informal advice and correction is the best and most effective way for an employer to deal with minor violations of work discipline. Repeated misconduct will warrant warnings, which themselves may be graded according to degrees of severity. More serious infringements or repeated misconduct may call for a final warning, or other action short of dismissal. Dismissal should be reserved for cases of serious misconduct or repeated offences.

(4) Generally, it is not appropriate to dismiss an employee for a first offence, except if the misconduct is serious and of such gravity that it makes a continued employment relationship intolerable. Examples of serious misconduct, subject to the rule that each case should be judged on its merits, are gross dishonesty or wilful damage to the property of the employer, wilful endangering of the safety of others, physical assault on the employer, a fellow employee, client or customer and gross insubordination. Whatever the merits of the case for dismissal might be, a dismissal will not be fair if it does not meet the requirements of section 188.

(5) When deciding whether or not to impose the penalty of dismissal, the employer should in addition to the gravity of the misconduct consider factors such as the employee's circumstances (including length of service, previous disciplinary record and personal circumstances, the nature of the job and the circumstances of the infringement itself.

(6) The employer should apply the penalty of dismissal consistently with the way in which it has been applied to the same and other employees in the past, and consistently as between two or more employees who participate in the misconduct under consideration.

4. Fair procedure

(1) Normally, the employer should conduct an investigation to determine whether there are grounds for dismissal. This does not need to be a formal enquiry. The employer should notify the employee of the allegations using a form and language that the employee can reasonably understand. The employee should be allowed the opportunity to state a case in response to the allegations. The employee should be entitled to a reasonable time to prepare the response and to the assistance of a trade union representative or fellow employee. After the enquiry, the employer should communicate the decision taken, and preferably furnish the employee with written notification of that decision.


Page 295:
===

(2) Discipline against a trade union representative or an employee who is an office-bearer or official of a trade union should not be instituted without first informing and consulting the trade union.

(3) If the employee is dismissed, the employee should be given the reason for dismissal and reminded of any rights to refer the matter to a council with jurisdiction or to the Commission or to any dispute resolution procedures established in terms of a collective agreement.

(4) In exceptional circumstances, if the employer cannot reasonably be expected to comply with these guidelines, the employer may dispense with pre-dismissal procedures.

5. Disciplinary records

Employers should keep records for each employee specifying the nature of any disciplinary transgressions, the actions taken by the employer and the reasons for the actions.

6. Dismissals and industrial action

(1) Participation in a strike that does not comply with the provisions of Chapter is misconduct. However, like any other act of misconduct, it does not always deserve dismissal. The substantive fairness of dismissal in these circumstances must be determined in the light of the facts of the case, including-

(a) the seriousness of the contravention of this Act;

(b) attempts made to comply with this Act; and

(c) whether or not the strike was in response to unjustified conduct by the employer.

(2) Prior to dismissal the employer should, at the earliest opportunity, contact a trade union official to discuss the course of action it intends to adopt. The employer should issue an ultimatum in clear and unambiguous terms that should state what is required of the employees and what sanction will be imposed if they do not comply with the ultimatum. The employees should be allowed sufficient time to reflect on the ultimatum and respond to it, either by complying with it or rejecting it. If the employer cannot reasonably be expected to extend these steps to the employees in question, the employer may dispense with them.


Page 296:
===

7. Guidelines in cases of dismissal for misconduct

Any person who is determining whether a dismissal for misconduct is unfair should consider-

(a) whether or not the employee contravened a rule or standard regulating conduct in, or of relevance to, the workplace; and

(b) if a rule or standard was contravened, whether or not-

(i) the rule was a valid or reasonable rule or standard;

(ii) the employee was aware, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the rule or standard;

(iii) the rule or standard has been consistently applied by the employer; and

(iv) dismissal was an appropriate sanction for the contravention of the rule or standard.

8. Incapacity poor work performance

Probation

(1)

(a) An employer may require a newly-hired employee to serve a period of probation before the appointment of the employee is confirmed.

(b) The purpose of probation is to give the employer an opportunity to evaluate the employee's performance before confirming the appointment.

(c) Probation should not be used for purposes not contemplated by this Code to deprive employees of the status of permanent employment. For example, a practice of dismissing employees who complete their probation periods and replacing them with newly-hired employees, is not consistent with the purpose of probation and constitutes an unfair labour practice.

(d) The period of probation should be determined in advance and be of reasonable duration. The length of the probationary period should be determined with reference to the nature of the job and the time it takes to determine the employee's suitability for continued employment.


Page 297:
===

(e) During the probationary period, the employee's performance should be assessed. An employer should give an employee reasonable evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling in order to allow the employee to render a satisfactory service.

(f) If the employer determines that the employee's performance is below standard, the employer should advise the employee of any aspects in which the employer considers the employee to be failing to meet the required performance standards. If the employer believes that the employee is incompetent, the employer should advise the employee of the respects in which the employee is not competent. The employer may either extend the probationary period or dismiss the employee after complying with subitems (g) or (h), as the case may be.

(g) The period of probation may only be extended for a reason that relates to the purpose of probation. The period of extension should not be disproportionate to the legitimate purpose that the employer seeks to achieve.

(h) An employer may only decide to dismiss an employee or extend the probationary period after the employer has invited the employee to make representations and has considered any representations made. A trade union representative or fellow employee may make the representations on behalf of the employee.

(i) If the employer decides to dismiss the employee or to extend the probationary period, the employer should advise the employee of his or her rights to refer the matter to a council having jurisdiction, or to the Commission.

(j) Any person making a decision about the fairness of a dismissal of an employee for poor work performance during or on expiry of the probationary period ought to accept reasons for dismissal that may be less compelling than would be the case in dismissals effected after the completion of the probationary period.

[Schedule 8 item 8(1) substituted by s 56 of Act 12 of 2002.]

(2) After probation, an employee should not be dismissed for unsatisfactory performance unless the employer has-

(a) given the employee appropriate evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling; and

(b) after a reasonable period of time for improvement, the employee continues to perform unsatisfactorily.


Page 298:
===

(3) The procedure leading to dismissal should include an investigation to establish the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance and the employer should consider other ways, short of dismissal, to remedy the matter.

(4) In the process, the employee should have the right to be heard and to be assisted by a trade union representative or a fellow employee.

9. Guidelines in cases of dismissal for poor work performance

Any person determining whether a dismissal for poor work performance is unfair should consider-

(a) whether or not the employee failed to meet a performance standard; and

(b) if the employee did not meet a required performance standard whether or not-

(i) the employee was aware, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the required performance standard;

(ii) the employee was given a fair opportunity to meet the required performance standard; and

(iii) dismissal was an appropriate sanction for not meeting the required performance standard.

10. Incapacity Ill health or injury

(1) Incapacity on the grounds of ill health or injury may be temporary or permanent. If an employee is temporarily unable to work in these circumstances, the employer should investigate the extent of the incapacity or the injury. If the employee is likely to be absent for a time that is unreasonably long in the circumstances, the employer should investigate all the possible alternatives short of dismissal. When alternatives are considered, relevant factors might include the nature of the job, the period of absence, the seriousness of the illness of injury and the possibility of securing a temporary replacement for the ill or injured employee. In cases of permanent incapacity, the employer should ascertain the possibility of securing alternative employment, or adapting the duties or work circumstances of the employee to accommodate the employee's disability.


Page 299:

(a) whether or not the employee is capable of performing the work; and

(b) if the employee is not capable-

(i) the extent to which the employee is able to perform the work;

(ii) the extent to which the employee's work circumstances might be adapted to accommodate disability, or, where this is not possible, the extent to which the employee's duties might be adapted; and
