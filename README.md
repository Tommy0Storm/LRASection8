# LRASection8

This project provides an interactive reference for Schedule 8 of the Labour Relations Act. The included `schedule8-masterpiece.html` page now features an animated flipbook section for a book-like reading experience.

## Setup

Run the `startup.sh` script to install recommended tooling and libraries. The script detects your operating system and installs Node.js along with useful utilities such as GitBook and Docusaurus.

```bash
./startup.sh
```

After running the script you can open `schedule8-masterpiece.html` in your browser.
